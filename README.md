Realtime logistical package tracking with Android.

## What about is this project?

This project is a software that can be used as a logistical package tracking software.
It links the delivery with the package hash, where the user can access the website and see where exactly his package was.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

## Why did you decide to develop this software?

As my last year in the university, I had to do something really useful and I aways wanted to learn how to make Android/iOS applications, so me and my group decide to make an logistical realtime tracking software, for those people who get ancious to know where his package is.

## What tecnologies are you using?

In this project, we decide to use mainly Node.js, to do the back-end and the web application. In the app, we are using Flutter and to do the QRCODE/BAR Code scan, we are using the [qrscan](https://pub.dev/packages/qrscan) library, with the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) library, to ask user's permission to use the camera for de scan.
